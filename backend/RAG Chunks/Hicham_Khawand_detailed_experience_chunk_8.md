**Personal**:
I am married and have a daughter born in 2020. We live in Solna, which offers the perfect balance of being outside the city center while remaining close to Stockholm.  
At the age of 23, following my father’s passing, I took on the responsibility of providing for my siblings, which taught me family responsibilities early in life. My primary goal is to provide the best possible life for my daughter, which is why we moved from Lebanon to Sweden—one of the best countries in the world for raising children.  
Personally, I feel a strong connection to European and Swedish culture, lebanon was always a bridge between east and west, however in late years this bridge was somehow broken and lebanon moved more towards the east, I respect eastern culture but western culture and specially freedom of expression resonates better with me and Sweden is a Bacon of personal freedom. While I am an introvert (assertive INTP as MBTI) (that also aligns well with most Swedish people), this does not affect my professional interactions, my colleagues won't know I am introverted. I enjoy business travel but prefer shorter trips now that I have a young child.
I have a work permit, it is my second two years work permit and i am not under northvolt's name anymore. the work permit end in September 2025, if everything worked properly I will have my permanent residency in September 2025.
I was born in Sin-El-Fil Lebanon in August 1983, my father was a writer (journalist and encyclopedia writer) and my mother worked in a book publishing company and a house wife. I am the oldest and have two brothers and a sister. One Brother working as journalist in Washington DC, another one in Dubai working in a company that manufactures water level sensors and my sister is also in Dubai working with Ralph Lauren in Marketing. I have no strong family ties to lebanon anymore, my father died in 2006 and my mother in 2014. I was married in 2018 to Christelle that is with me here in Solna as well as my child Chloe born in February 2020.

**Describe a moment in your life that fundamentally changed your worldview. What happened, and how did it alter your perspective?**  
Losing both of my parents at a young age profoundly shaped my outlook on life. My father passed away when I was 23, and my mother followed when I was 30. These losses brought immense responsibilities, such as caring for my younger siblings, and exposed me to life's harsh realities early on.
I learned that resilience and self-reliance are crucial, as no one is obligated to help you, and you cannot depend on others or a higher power to solve your problems. However, I also discovered that with strength and perseverance, you can shape life in your favor.

**Have you ever felt completely out of place? How did you cope, and what did you learn from the experience?** 
I adapt quickly, learning from mistakes and adjusting my beliefs when evidence suggests a better path (though my core values, like authenticity, remain constant). Over time, I felt increasingly trapped in Lebanon, surrounded by outdated beliefs, superstitions, and harmful habits.  
By my late 30s, I realized that my society was entrenched in economic and political struggles, leading to self-destruction. Driven by the desire to secure a better future for my daughter, I decided to move to a more stable country—Sweden. This decision forced me to act and ultimately transformed my life for the better (well maybe not now exactly but I believe it will).
