Mentorship at Technica: I developed a Unity-based simulation game directly connected to S7-1200 PLCs, which I used in workshops to teach engineers programming in Siemens SCL language when it was relatively new (we previously used Ladder and STL). I was also the go-to person whenever an engineer encountered a challenging technical problem.

Leadership at Technica: I led a small vision inspection team (2 engineers) and a digital services team (IoT, track and trace, VR/AR, 3-4 engineers) within the larger R&D division. Under my leadership, we secured our first “software-only” project. Additionally, I participated in a one-year leadership development program with a personal life coach, which significantly improved both my personal and professional skills. For instance, I worked on enhancing my assertiveness and discovered that I am an INTP personality type (MBTI). Over time, I evolved into an “assertive INTP,” which is notable since INTPs typically struggle in team environments. However, I successfully adapted and thrived in team settings.

Leadership at Northvolt: I led a team of two automation engineers in Poland, as well as a senior automation engineer and another automation engineer in Stockholm. Acting as a technical mentor, I guided them in developing the entire communication stack for all 34 PLCs to integrate with our MES system, saving significant costs as the supplier had quoted an exorbitant amount for the task. I spearheaded the project, conducted team meetings, and held one-on-one sessions. While I found myself more inclined toward technical leadership than people management, I demonstrated strong capabilities in both areas, even though people management was not my primary preference at the time.
