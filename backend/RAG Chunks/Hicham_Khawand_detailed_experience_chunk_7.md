**How do you prioritize your time?**  
I prioritize my time by focusing on tasks that have the most impact and clarity. I break down tasks based on urgency and long-term value. For smaller, important tasks, I address them immediately. For larger tasks, I evaluate their worth before committing. I avoid letting backlogs grow unnecessarily and quickly reprioritize if something more critical arises. I also ensure to block time for deep, focused work and minimize distractions or meetings that don’t add value.

**Let’s say we hire you and 6 months down the road things are just not working out. What would have caused that?**  
If things aren’t working out after 6 months, it’s likely due to being underutilized or micromanaged—both of which significantly impact my motivation. I thrive in environments where I’m trusted to take ownership and solve problems independently. I prefer working on meaningful tasks rather than just ticking boxes. If decisions are slow or I’m constantly told how to do my job instead of being aligned on goals, it could lead to frustration. That said, I always aim to raise concerns early, align expectations, and adapt as needed. Autonomy and impact are essential for me to stay engaged.

What are your top 3 strengths? – and give examples  
1. **Problem-Solving Mindset:** I excel at finding efficient solutions, even in complex or ambiguous situations. For example, transitioning from a hardware/automation background to cloud and software engineering, I quickly became a meaningful contributor by breaking down problems and learning fast. I embrace calculated risks to fail and learn quickly. In my last role, I actively supported MES mappers in the team channel, even when I initially struggled. Over time, I became a reliable operations support for MES.  
2. **Grit and Ownership:** I take full responsibility for my work and persevere through challenges. Whether it’s managing a demanding job, moving countries, or being the sole provider for my family, I stay focused and deliver. For instance, despite external pressures to return to Lebanon, I remained committed to my goals and never wavered.  
3. **Critical Thinking and Clarity:** I challenge the status quo and focus on what truly makes sense. For example, I proposed using AI and Copilot to create an efficient chart for edge mappers, cutting through unnecessary complexity. However, when faced with urgent or business-critical problems, I act immediately without overanalyzing.

What is a weakness you have? – and how do you manage this?  
One of my weaknesses is that I can be overly blunt or logical in communication, especially in personal settings. I tend to focus on facts rather than emotions, which can sometimes come across as cold or intense to more sensitive individuals. Professionally, I’ve learned to communicate more thoughtfully and am generally perceived as approachable. In the past, I also struggled with assertiveness, often hesitating to speak up when I noticed issues. Over time, I’ve worked on this and improved significantly, which has come with experience and maturity.
 
Personal Project:  
In 2018, I embarked on a project to transform a standard industrial robot into a 6-axis milling robot. I purchased a used Staubli industrial robot, a servo drive for the turning table, and designed my own electrical panel. You can view some videos of the “Woodbot” here:

Although the project ultimately failed to be profitable, it taught me valuable lessons about the challenges of entrepreneurship.

I also experimented with AI by creating a Unity3D simulation that users can interact with, using an OpenAI assistant integrated with a knowledge base and function-calling APIs.
