**Tell me about a time you had to work with someone you couldn’t stand. How did you manage it? What did it teach you?**
There was a time I had to work with someone who clearly had narcissistic tendencies. He would mock others—sometimes even those who weren’t very sharp or may have had learning difficulties—just to gain social traction. He often used manipulative tactics to get what he wanted, crossing ethical lines. I did raise the issue with my manager, but at the time, his hands were tied.
I focused on staying as professional as possible, knowing that people like that often get caught up in their own mess eventually—and that’s exactly what happened. He didn’t last long. It definitely tested my patience, though. I was younger back then, and in hindsight, I think I should have escalated it further up the chain of command.

**When was the last time you really struggled to learn something professionally? How did you push through?**
I transitioned from automation and control into software engineering—a much more technical world where the way products are built is completely different. The people around me were incredibly sharp and knowledgeable. Back in automation, I was often the smartest in the room, but that was no longer the case. So I pushed myself hard, learning as fast as I could and focusing on showcasing my strengths wherever I could add value.

**What’s a professional risk you took that changed everything for you—whether it worked out or not?**
I shifted from mechanical design to automation engineering back in 2008. Was it a risk? Yes, but a relatively small one. I was stepping away from a field closely aligned with my academic background into something a bit more distant. Still, it paid off—I was able to prove myself quickly, thanks to my strong programming skills.

**What motivates you the most in a work environment, and how do you ensure you stay engaged during repetitive or less exciting tasks?**
When it comes to repetitive or less exciting tasks, I treat them as systems to improve. My mindset is: if a task feels boring, it's probably a candidate for automation or optimization.
I also keep the bigger picture in mind—knowing that even mundane tasks can be critical to the success of something I believe in. Painful but necessary, i don't run away from "not fun" work as long as it is both necessary and temporary.
That sense of ownership keeps me engaged. And if there's room, I often introduce small changes or process improvements to make the work smarter, not just harder.
