Among the projects I worked on are:

- **P&G Projects (Egypt, Dammam, Mataro, Spain - 2008):** These projects introduced me to PackML, MES (in its early days), international specifications, functional safety, and rigorous safety training. At P&G Egypt, I experienced strict production demands, where even minor production halts were escalated to the CEO. I developed a unique synchronization system using advanced PID to enable multiple packing machines to operate on a single line without interference. This software was later adopted by P&G for similar in-house panels. The work involved Allen Bradley PLCs (ControlLogix, CompactLogix) and technologies like DeviceNet and ControlNet.

- **Mars Egypt (2016):** I gained insights into food safety and hygienic designs while programming a line with Rockwell CompactLogix and a smart camera for detecting broken chocolate bars. I also resolved a recurring issue with burned cameras caused by improper welding practices near the equipment.

- **Al-Marai Projects:** These included various commissioning trips to factories like CPP2, CPP3, and 7-Days in Saudi Arabia. I worked on pallet lines, MES communication, and complex pallet inspection machines using LMS4000 scanners and custom software with the PCL library and C++.

- **Dairy Factories (e.g., Al-Safi Danone, Nada, Nadec):** Focused on crate conveyor lines, palletizing machines, and packing systems.

- **Cola Factories like Coca cola and Pepsico (Amman, Jeddah, Abha) :** Focused on a pallet mixing system (the most challenging regarding PLC logic), palletizers and conveyors.

- **Savola Oil Bottling Line:** Designed and commissioned Technicaâ€™s first 3-in-1 machine (carton erector, packer, and sealer).

- **Truck Loading Machines:** Initially a collaboration with P&G Global, later developed as a Technica project.

- **Vision Inspection Systems:** Developed an in-house mirror system with GigE cameras and Microscan software for inspecting empty plastic bottles.

- **Unity-Based Emulator for Sales (2021):** Created a Unity emulator to simulate pallet tracking for a Dubai water bottle factory. This helped secure a software-only project by showcasing the concept effectively.

- **Unity3D Conveyor Library (2020):** Developed a library to auto-generate belt and roller conveyors.

- **VR Simulation for Laban Cups Line (2019):** Created a VR simulation of an end-of-line system, allowing users to interact with devices and observe system reactions in real-time. This was showcased at the Rockwell Automation Fair.

- **Delta Robot Issue Resolution (2012):** Diagnosed and resolved a recurring issue with a delta robot in a pharmaceutical company by identifying relay-induced signal bounces.

- **Most simulation experiences** Visual components where i started scripting in Python, ABB Robotstudio, and most importantly Unity3D where I free to create whatever I wanted with no restrictions.

- **Northvolt Projects:** 
    - Assisted automation engineers in understanding PackML (2021).
    - Led automation discussions for an ESS factory line in Poland, covering standards, networking, MES communication, and electrical design.
    - Troubleshot edge mappers and MES services written in Go.
    - Conducted data analysis for OEE improvement using Redshift, LookML, Athena, OpenSearch, and Grafana Loki.
    - Currently developing a Unity3D simulation integrated with a virtual OPC-UA server to generate traceability events and telemetry data.

These projects highlight my ability to adapt, innovate, and deliver impactful solutions across diverse industries and technologies.
