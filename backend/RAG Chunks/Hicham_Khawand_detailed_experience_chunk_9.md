**Who has had the greatest influence on the person you are today? What did they teach you, directly or indirectly?**
Several people have had a profound impact on me.  
My father instilled in me strong principles and values, along with a deep love for my country. I embraced those values but adapted them to my perspective. He also taught me the importance of independent thinking.  
My mother demonstrated unwavering dedication in raising us despite the many challenges she faced.  
The founder of Technica inspired me with his resilience—building and sustaining a company in Lebanon during the war and persisting through the country's difficult times. While I admire his optimism about Lebanon, I consider myself more pragmatic.  
Finally, my wife and child have unknowingly motivated me to strive for a better life for them, which has had the most significant impact on me.

**What keeps you grounded or pushes you forward on tough days?**  
When I face challenging days, I remind myself of the bigger picture. I think about the people who depend on me, like my wife and daughter, and the responsibilities I have toward them.  
I also reflect on the obstacles I've overcome in the past (and there have been many) and how they've made me stronger.  
This perspective helps me stay grounded and motivates me to keep moving forward, knowing I have the strength and resilience to overcome any challenges.

**Have you ever made a decision that defied others' expectations but felt undeniably right? What was that like?**  
Yes, both professionally and personally. I've made decisions that went against others' expectations but felt right for me. For instance, when I decided to move to Sweden, many questioned my choice, as it meant leaving behind my family, friends, and the company I had been with for 15 years.  
Professionally, I've had moments where I stood my ground, which some might call stubbornness, but I trust my intuition when backed by experience. For example, I once resolved a network issue with a remote device in China. While the platform team insisted it was due to a Chinese ISP restriction, I trusted my instincts and identified the problem as a firmware issue. Despite poor remote access, I found a way to update the firmware and successfully fixed the issue.

**What’s a truth about yourself that took you years to accept?**
That I may not fit in properly in certain societies.

**Is there a version of yourself from the past that you sometimes miss? What part of them do you wish you still had today?**
Yes, over the years, I’ve developed a thick skin. However, I sometimes wish I could regain my hypersensitivity or softer side to better empathize and connect with others. At times, my thick skin can make me feel a bit detached.

**What’s a job or task that made you question your entire career path—and how did you handle that doubt?**
I often question whether transitioning from hardware to software was the right decision, especially with the rapid advancements in AI. However, seeing the complexity involved in real-world software products gives me some reassurance. Additionally, I can always combine my expertise in both fields to contribute to the growing field of Physical AI, which is currently gaining significant attention.
