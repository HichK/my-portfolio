Annual Impact Summary 2025
Business Impact – Contribution
Employee: What contributions are you most proud of in the past year? What are your key learnings?
Connect back to team or individual goals if applicable.
I officially joined the SWE team on August 1st, and over these past 7 months, I’m proud of the following achievements:
1.	Self-driven onboarding: I took ownership of my onboarding process, minimizing the need for intervention from leads. While this approach may have caused me to miss some minor details, it allowed the tech leads to stay focused on their work and gave me the chance to fast-track my learning through calculated (and relatively safe) trial and error.
2.	Building Looker dashboards and Redshift queries from scratch to support the autocategorization efforts.
3.	Taking initiative to push, manage, and briefly lead the implementation of fixes for the OEE enabler — even if it was only for a short period, I gave it my best shot.
4.	Quickly picking up Scala and Flink to identify and troubleshoot a bug in the downtime-service.
5.	Supporting Anthony with expansion projects almost immediately after joining — by end of August, I was already contributing to API diagrams, DS3 stacker vFATs, NOVO vFATs, and more.

Behavioral Impact – Values

Employee: How have you demonstrated Northvolts' values over the past year?
Our values: Bold, Passionate and Excellent. Read more here.

Bold: Taking the initiative to push for a permanent solution to improve roll2roll yields using segmentation and the go-service-roll.
Bold - Excellent: Refusing to accept that the connectivity issue during the DS3 stacker vFAT was simply due to “Chinese internet” — instead, I took it upon myself to investigate and resolve the problem, even though it technically fell under the platforms team’s ownership.
Passionate: Actively contributing to the FDE team channel within my first month as an FDE engineer, fully aware that I might make mistakes (calculated risks), but I saw this as an opportunity to accelerate my onboarding.
Passionate: Showing strong enthusiasm for promoting the benefits of a machine 3D simulator, even dedicating some overtime hours to work on it.
Passionate: Encouraging myself and others to aim for the ambitious goal of the carveout, even if the path wasn’t fully clear.
Bold: Noticing the absence of a proper chart illustrating how the mappers communicate with both machines and the cloud, so I took the initiative to spend a few days building it directly from the repositories’ code (with the help of Copilot), despite knowing this could potentially overlap with other teams’ work. This also allowed me to push myself into the “Machine Integrations” workstream.

Growth – Potential
Employee: How would you like to develop in the coming year? What support do you need to develop and improve at work?
I want to continue rapidly developing my software engineering skills, building on my background as an automation and machine control engineer. One way to achieve this is by actively contributing to different teams across projects, gaining exposure to various technologies and approaches.
In the longer term, I aspire to lead an initiative, such as an “emulator” project, while staying hands-on with the technical work — maintaining my technical involvement is essential for my motivation and job satisfaction.
