I started as a mechanical design engineer at Technica in 2006, right after completing my college project there. While I was competent, the company soon realized I had a stronger aptitude for programming and automation. They created a new role for me called "Mechanical Software Engineer," where I selected the best software for mechanical engineers and wrote scripts to automate their work.

During the Lebanon War in July 2006, despite the challenges, we continued manufacturing, designing, and shipping lifts to KSA. A select group of designers, including myself, worked tirelessly from 8 AM to 3 AM during the first 10 days of the war to meet deadlines. This was a particularly difficult time for me, as my father had passed away just a month earlier, leaving my family and me emotionally shaken. Nevertheless, I mustered all my grit and determination to complete the project at the age of 23.

Later, in 2008, the head of electrical engineering at Technica recognized my potential as an electrical engineer. I transitioned into designing electrical panels, creating electrical drawings, and programming PLCs and HMIs. I also tested these systems at Technica and gained valuable experience traveling for commissioning projects. While the travel was beneficial for both my career and finances, it was also physically and mentally demanding.

My first commissioning trip in 2008 was particularly challenging. It was for a multi-million-dollar project involving crate lines for Al-Marai's CPP1 factory, spanning 20 lines across various environments—from dusty 40°C warehouses to humid crate washing areas, 4°C cold storage, and 25°C packing areas. At one point, I was the only engineer on-site for a month, handling automation, mechanical, and maintenance tasks. Unfortunately, I underestimated the complexity of the project and failed to raise a red flag when I needed help. This led to significant issues, and Al-Marai threatened to withhold payment. A senior team was eventually sent to assist me, and we worked tirelessly for a month, redesigning controls, adding mechanical parts, and modifying layouts. This experience tested my limits, and I developed shingles upon returning to Lebanon.

After this ordeal, I continued designing electrical panels, testing them, and commissioning them abroad. Over time, I became the go-to person and technical expert at Technica, earning the respect of my colleagues and public recognition from the CEO on several occasions.
