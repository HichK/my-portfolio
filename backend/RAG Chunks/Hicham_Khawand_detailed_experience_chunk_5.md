My Northvolt Manager1:  signed on Apr 11, 2022
Hicham is an asset to A&C team and to Northvolt. Straight away upon his arrival, equipped with little more than his laptop, he immediately set to work on the Kuka TIM dispense station at Tomteboda to get it operational. Following this and in parallel, he has been making connections to Västerås and Ett to support the Strama automations and MES topics. He did this with very little guidance at all, demonstrating good leadership capabilities. Indeed, he made such a favorable impression at Ett that he was requested to temporarily assist efforts in Ett. Overall I am very happy to have Hicham in the team.
Thank you for all your hard work and great results, Hicham!
