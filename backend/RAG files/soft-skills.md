## Resilience & Grit
- Persevered through high-stress situations, including working during the Lebanon-Israel war and managing a solo commissioning at Almarai.
- Consistently met project deadlines despite emotional, logistical, or technical challenges.

## Self-Driven & Independent
- Self-onboarded into complex environments (e.g., Northvolt) with minimal support.
- Proactively filled knowledge gaps by learning new tools (Scala, Flink, AWS, LookML).
- Initiated solutions without waiting for directives — e.g., emulator project, conveyor generator, VR training tools.

## Problem Solving & Critical Thinking
- Strong analytical approach to diagnosing root causes — from relay signal noise to connectivity issues in remote vFATs.
- Sees through complexity and builds elegant, practical solutions — often from scratch.

## Communication & Transparency
- Speaks plainly and with authenticity, not overusing corporate jargon.
- Freely shares lessons from past failures and actively integrates feedback.
- Balances blunt honesty with respect and humility.

## Leadership & Mentorship
- Trusted mentor to junior engineers.
- Led software, vision, and digital teams to successful project deliveries.
- Took part in a leadership program and applied the learnings in professional growth.

## Adaptability & Cross-cultural Collaboration
- Worked successfully with teams across Europe, the Middle East, and global corporations like P&G and Mars.
- Transitioned from mechanical to electrical to software to cloud — and back — with ease.
- Open to feedback and quick to adapt to shifting priorities and roles.

## Deep Curiosity & Learning Drive
- Frequently builds tools (emulators, Unity simulations) to solve or explain things.
- Pursues learning outside his role — e.g., creating training simulators, engaging with edge compute tech.
- Interested in both tactical execution and strategic system design.

## Authenticity & Integrity
- Maintains personal integrity even under pressure.
- Questions social pressure and traditional norms if they conflict with rational, ethical standards.
