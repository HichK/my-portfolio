Hicham Khawand (About me, in details)
17169 Solna, Stockholm | (+46) 73-337 48 54 | hicham.khawand@gmail.com | linkedin.com/in/hicham-khawand

Software Engineering Beginnings (1995-2006): My journey into software engineering started during my college summer break in 2002, working with relatives who were Microsoft employees (one of them was among the first programmers of PowerPoint). By then, I already had a solid foundation in programming, having learned Turbo Pascal earlier, the project was in Visual basic .net, VB.Net 2002 was one of my earliest programming languages.
Programming and coding courses, ranging from Turbo Pascal to microchip assembly, were my favorites. While many classmates found these subjects challenging, they came naturally to me. As a child, I had a PC and was proficient in DOS. I even enjoyed modifying game files and external scripts to cheat, as they were rarely encrypted back then.
At school, I was most drawn to classes that allowed hands-on experience with computers. My first encounter with a PC was in 1991 at a neighbor’s house, where I played Pac-Man.

Food Industry Introduction (1999): My initial exposure to the food industry was through a cousin who owned a coffee bean roasting and packaging factory. Among the advanced equipment in the factory was a Bosch machine capable of vacuum packaging coffee. The factory also featured a sophisticated SCADA system at the time (circa 1999), allowing real-time monitoring of processes and tanks.

College and Mechatronics (2001-2006): ULFG2 was not the most prestigious college in Lebanon, but it was known for its rigor, requiring grit, intelligence, and resilience to succeed. I wasn’t particularly fond of the “integral triple” (in French) and the highly theoretical mathematics required for electrical engineering, which was a prerequisite for software engineering (“courant faible” in French) at my college. Instead, I opted for a more hands-on field: mechanical and mechatronics engineering.
During this time, I took charge of the college’s “computer club” around 2005, where I managed the club’s assets and maintained the PCs’ software. This role also allowed me to enhance my skills in 3ds Max and Visual Turbo Pascal. One of my internships was at “Air Liquide,” where I developed a completely updated PID (Piping and Instrumentation Diagram) from scratch.
I performed well in mechanical engineering and achieved good grades. In my final semester, we were tasked with a capstone project. A friend guided our team to combine the project with an internship at Technica International in 2006. The project involved designing a trio of systems: a tray inserter, a glass palletizer with a pantograph, and an automatic tray magazine. My primary responsibility was the tray magazine. Additionally, I created a video for the jury using 3ds Max, blending 3D animation with real footage to showcase our work.

Experience Use Cases: I began my career in mechanical design at Technica International, the company where I completed my final college project. I spent several years there in various roles, with my last position being “Director of External Digital Division.” However, I did not include this title in my CV as it lasted only six months and does not align with the European definition of a director role.

One of my earliest achievements was automating a tedious process for mechanical engineers. In 2006, I noticed that engineers spent around 30percent of their time manually updating design drawings when copying a system or machine design from one project to another. This involved updating layout labels, execution drawings, designer names, and dates. To address this, I created a VBA macro in AutoCAD that reduced hours of work to just five minutes.

I started as a mechanical design engineer at Technica in 2006, right after completing my college project there. While I was competent, the company soon realized I had a stronger aptitude for programming and automation. They created a new role for me called "Mechanical Software Engineer," where I selected the best software for mechanical engineers and wrote scripts to automate their work.

During the Lebanon War in July 2006, despite the challenges, we continued manufacturing, designing, and shipping lifts to KSA. A select group of designers, including myself, worked tirelessly from 8 AM to 3 AM during the first 10 days of the war to meet deadlines. This was a particularly difficult time for me, as my father had passed away just a month earlier, leaving my family and me emotionally shaken. Nevertheless, I mustered all my grit and determination to complete the project at the age of 23.

Later, in 2008, the head of electrical engineering at Technica recognized my potential as an electrical engineer. I transitioned into designing electrical panels, creating electrical drawings, and programming PLCs and HMIs. I also tested these systems at Technica and gained valuable experience traveling for commissioning projects. While the travel was beneficial for both my career and finances, it was also physically and mentally demanding.

My first commissioning trip in 2008 was particularly challenging. It was for a multi-million-dollar project involving crate lines for Al-Marai's CPP1 factory, spanning 20 lines across various environments—from dusty 40°C warehouses to humid crate washing areas, 4°C cold storage, and 25°C packing areas. At one point, I was the only engineer on-site for a month, handling automation, mechanical, and maintenance tasks. Unfortunately, I underestimated the complexity of the project and failed to raise a red flag when I needed help. This led to significant issues, and Al-Marai threatened to withhold payment. A senior team was eventually sent to assist me, and we worked tirelessly for a month, redesigning controls, adding mechanical parts, and modifying layouts. This experience tested my limits, and I developed shingles upon returning to Lebanon.

After this ordeal, I continued designing electrical panels, testing them, and commissioning them abroad. Over time, I became the go-to person and technical expert at Technica, earning the respect of my colleagues and public recognition from the CEO on several occasions.

Among the projects I worked on are:

- **P&G Projects (Egypt, Dammam, Mataro, Spain - 2008):** These projects introduced me to PackML, MES (in its early days), international specifications, functional safety, and rigorous safety training. At P&G Egypt, I experienced strict production demands, where even minor production halts were escalated to the CEO. I developed a unique synchronization system using advanced PID to enable multiple packing machines to operate on a single line without interference. This software was later adopted by P&G for similar in-house panels. The work involved Allen Bradley PLCs (ControlLogix, CompactLogix) and technologies like DeviceNet and ControlNet.

- **Mars Egypt (2016):** I gained insights into food safety and hygienic designs while programming a line with Rockwell CompactLogix and a smart camera for detecting broken chocolate bars. I also resolved a recurring issue with burned cameras caused by improper welding practices near the equipment.

- **Al-Marai Projects:** These included various commissioning trips to factories like CPP2, CPP3, and 7-Days in Saudi Arabia. I worked on pallet lines, MES communication, and complex pallet inspection machines using LMS4000 scanners and custom software with the PCL library and C++.

- **Dairy Factories (e.g., Al-Safi Danone, Nada, Nadec):** Focused on crate conveyor lines, palletizing machines, and packing systems.

- **Cola Factories like Coca cola and Pepsico (Amman, Jeddah, Abha) :** Focused on a pallet mixing system (the most challenging regarding PLC logic), palletizers and conveyors.

- **Savola Oil Bottling Line:** Designed and commissioned Technica’s first 3-in-1 machine (carton erector, packer, and sealer).

- **Truck Loading Machines:** Initially a collaboration with P&G Global, later developed as a Technica project.

- **Vision Inspection Systems:** Developed an in-house mirror system with GigE cameras and Microscan software for inspecting empty plastic bottles.

- **Unity-Based Emulator for Sales (2021):** Created a Unity emulator to simulate pallet tracking for a Dubai water bottle factory. This helped secure a software-only project by showcasing the concept effectively.

- **Unity3D Conveyor Library (2020):** Developed a library to auto-generate belt and roller conveyors.

- **VR Simulation for Laban Cups Line (2019):** Created a VR simulation of an end-of-line system, allowing users to interact with devices and observe system reactions in real-time. This was showcased at the Rockwell Automation Fair.

- **Delta Robot Issue Resolution (2012):** Diagnosed and resolved a recurring issue with a delta robot in a pharmaceutical company by identifying relay-induced signal bounces.

- **Most simulation experiences** Visual components where i started scripting in Python, ABB Robotstudio, and most importantly Unity3D where I free to create whatever I wanted with no restrictions.

- **Northvolt Projects:** 
    - Assisted automation engineers in understanding PackML (2021).
    - Led automation discussions for an ESS factory line in Poland, covering standards, networking, MES communication, and electrical design.
    - Troubleshot edge mappers and MES services written in Go.
    - Conducted data analysis for OEE improvement using Redshift, LookML, Athena, OpenSearch, and Grafana Loki.
    - Currently developing a Unity3D simulation integrated with a virtual OPC-UA server to generate traceability events and telemetry data.

These projects highlight my ability to adapt, innovate, and deliver impactful solutions across diverse industries and technologies.


Mentorship at Technica: I developed a Unity-based simulation game directly connected to S7-1200 PLCs, which I used in workshops to teach engineers programming in Siemens SCL language when it was relatively new (we previously used Ladder and STL). I was also the go-to person whenever an engineer encountered a challenging technical problem.

Leadership at Technica: I led a small vision inspection team (2 engineers) and a digital services team (IoT, track and trace, VR/AR, 3-4 engineers) within the larger R&D division. Under my leadership, we secured our first “software-only” project. Additionally, I participated in a one-year leadership development program with a personal life coach, which significantly improved both my personal and professional skills. For instance, I worked on enhancing my assertiveness and discovered that I am an INTP personality type (MBTI). Over time, I evolved into an “assertive INTP,” which is notable since INTPs typically struggle in team environments. However, I successfully adapted and thrived in team settings.

Leadership at Northvolt: I led a team of two automation engineers in Poland, as well as a senior automation engineer and another automation engineer in Stockholm. Acting as a technical mentor, I guided them in developing the entire communication stack for all 34 PLCs to integrate with our MES system, saving significant costs as the supplier had quoted an exorbitant amount for the task. I spearheaded the project, conducted team meetings, and held one-on-one sessions. While I found myself more inclined toward technical leadership than people management, I demonstrated strong capabilities in both areas, even though people management was not my primary preference at the time.



Annual Impact Summary 2025
Business Impact – Contribution

Employee: What contributions are you most proud of in the past year? What are your key learnings?
Connect back to team or individual goals if applicable.
I officially joined the SWE team on August 1st, and over these past 7 months, I’m proud of the following achievements:
1.	Self-driven onboarding: I took ownership of my onboarding process, minimizing the need for intervention from leads. While this approach may have caused me to miss some minor details, it allowed the tech leads to stay focused on their work and gave me the chance to fast-track my learning through calculated (and relatively safe) trial and error.
2.	Building Looker dashboards and Redshift queries from scratch to support the autocategorization efforts.
3.	Taking initiative to push, manage, and briefly lead the implementation of fixes for the OEE enabler — even if it was only for a short period, I gave it my best shot.
4.	Quickly picking up Scala and Flink to identify and troubleshoot a bug in the downtime-service.
5.	Supporting Anthony with expansion projects almost immediately after joining — by end of August, I was already contributing to API diagrams, DS3 stacker vFATs, NOVO vFATs, and more.

Behavioral Impact – Values

Employee: How have you demonstrated Northvolts' values over the past year?
Our values: Bold, Passionate and Excellent. Read more here.

Bold: Taking the initiative to push for a permanent solution to improve roll2roll yields using segmentation and the go-service-roll.
Bold - Excellent: Refusing to accept that the connectivity issue during the DS3 stacker vFAT was simply due to “Chinese internet” — instead, I took it upon myself to investigate and resolve the problem, even though it technically fell under the platforms team’s ownership.
Passionate: Actively contributing to the FDE team channel within my first month as an FDE engineer, fully aware that I might make mistakes (calculated risks), but I saw this as an opportunity to accelerate my onboarding.
Passionate: Showing strong enthusiasm for promoting the benefits of a machine 3D simulator, even dedicating some overtime hours to work on it.
Passionate: Encouraging myself and others to aim for the ambitious goal of the carveout, even if the path wasn’t fully clear.
Bold: Noticing the absence of a proper chart illustrating how the mappers communicate with both machines and the cloud, so I took the initiative to spend a few days building it directly from the repositories’ code (with the help of Copilot), despite knowing this could potentially overlap with other teams’ work. This also allowed me to push myself into the “Machine Integrations” workstream.

Growth – Potential
Employee: How would you like to develop in the coming year? What support do you need to develop and improve at work?
I want to continue rapidly developing my software engineering skills, building on my background as an automation and machine control engineer. One way to achieve this is by actively contributing to different teams across projects, gaining exposure to various technologies and approaches.
In the longer term, I aspire to lead an initiative, such as an “emulator” project, while staying hands-on with the technical work — maintaining my technical involvement is essential for my motivation and job satisfaction.



My Northvolt Manager1:  signed on Apr 11, 2022
Hicham is an asset to A&C team and to Northvolt. Straight away upon his arrival, equipped with little more than his laptop, he immediately set to work on the Kuka TIM dispense station at Tomteboda to get it operational. Following this and in parallel, he has been making connections to Västerås and Ett to support the Strama automations and MES topics. He did this with very little guidance at all, demonstrating good leadership capabilities. Indeed, he made such a favorable impression at Ett that he was requested to temporarily assist efforts in Ett. Overall I am very happy to have Hicham in the team.
Thank you for all your hard work and great results, Hicham!

My Key Accomplishments:
1. **Emulator that worked for Sales (Technica)**  
In February 2021, I led a small software team of three engineers at an OEM machine manufacturing company. We had an opportunity to sell our first software-only product for tracking and tracing plastic pallets (more expensive than wooden ones) at a Dubai water bottle factory.  
To pitch the idea, I developed a Unity-based emulator with a top-down GTA 2-style view, integrated with MongoDB. The emulator simulated forklifts, pallet scanning, and deliveries. Additionally, an early version of the Android app, designed for Zebra readers (our target product), dynamically updated in real-time based on the emulator's actions.  
The emulator was a success—it helped us secure the project! While it wasn’t reused, it demonstrated the power of a well-crafted emulator in effectively selling an idea.  

2. **Emulator that worked in Cutting Costs (Technica)**  
In 2016, we received our first layer mixing project, featuring six uniform pallet infeeds and two mixed pallet outfeeds. The robot was Kuka’s first 1000kg model, and while its control (and the overall line control) was challenging, the biggest hurdle was the algorithm. It had to determine which infeed to take from, ensuring no deadlocks, minimizing cycle time, and reducing forklift movements—a real chess game.  
To address this, I created a line emulator that simulated the infeeds and communicated via simple TCP/IP messages (for speed) with an old S7-300 PLC emulator (two emulators communicating). This allowed us to write and test code directly on the PLC before deployment.  
It took six months to develop but saved two months in physical testing and commissioning. Was it worth it? Absolutely. During commissioning, we had two engineers and two technicians in a foreign country, with additional expenses, incentives, and a customer holding payment until completion. The emulator significantly reduced risks, making the time investment well worth it.  

3. **Leading the Electrical and Automation Design of a Full ESS Manufacturing Line (Northvolt)**  
The line included several fully automated machines and 34 PLCs. Initially, I worked alone before being joined by an automation engineer whom I mentored through the project. Later, a newly recruited manager took over after eight months, as the workload was exhausting. However, I continued focusing on the MES communication aspect of the line.  
During this time, I served as the main automation lead, collaborating with several automation project managers and technical leads from the supplier side. I oversaw, discussed, and approved PLC control, electrical design, labeling, naming conventions, MES communication, network architecture, HMI control, and led design workshops.  
At the line commissioning in Poland, I led a small team to modify the PLC software of all 34 PLCs to ensure proper communication with our in-house MES system. It was rewarding to see the line operational, even if only for a few months, as Northvolt eventually went bankrupt. 

**Google foobar**  
In 2021, before the AI hype, Google’s Foobar challenge randomly popped up for me while I was searching online. I got to level 4 before pausing it out of fatigue. Later, I noticed a Google recruiter checked my LinkedIn profile, probably out of curiosity, but I assume my experience didn’t match the standard expectations for a SWE profile. It’s just another example of how my background doesn’t always reflect what I’m capable of.

**Why Did You Leave your old company?**  
Technica is a reputable company with strong values and was conveniently located near my home in Bikfaya, Lebanon. While they tried to create new roles to retain me, I felt saturated in my position. However, my decision to leave wasn’t due to Technica itself but rather the rapidly deteriorating economic situation in Lebanon.  
Despite earning a high salary that allowed me to afford solar panels for 24/7 electricity, periodic water purchases, and other necessities, the collapsing medical system, road safety, political instability, and overall security made it unsustainable. I needed a functioning government and a better future for my daughter and family, which led me to move to Sweden.

How do you prioritize your time?  
I prioritize my time by focusing on tasks that have the most impact and clarity. I break down tasks based on urgency and long-term value. For smaller, important tasks, I address them immediately. For larger tasks, I evaluate their worth before committing. I avoid letting backlogs grow unnecessarily and quickly reprioritize if something more critical arises. I also ensure to block time for deep, focused work and minimize distractions or meetings that don’t add value.

Let’s say we hire you and 6 months down the road things are just not working out. What would have caused that?  
If things aren’t working out after 6 months, it’s likely due to being underutilized or micromanaged—both of which significantly impact my motivation. I thrive in environments where I’m trusted to take ownership and solve problems independently. I prefer working on meaningful tasks rather than just ticking boxes. If decisions are slow or I’m constantly told how to do my job instead of being aligned on goals, it could lead to frustration. That said, I always aim to raise concerns early, align expectations, and adapt as needed. Autonomy and impact are essential for me to stay engaged.

What are your top 3 strengths? – and give examples  
1. **Problem-Solving Mindset:** I excel at finding efficient solutions, even in complex or ambiguous situations. For example, transitioning from a hardware/automation background to cloud and software engineering, I quickly became a meaningful contributor by breaking down problems and learning fast. I embrace calculated risks to fail and learn quickly. In my last role, I actively supported MES mappers in the team channel, even when I initially struggled. Over time, I became a reliable operations support for MES.  
2. **Grit and Ownership:** I take full responsibility for my work and persevere through challenges. Whether it’s managing a demanding job, moving countries, or being the sole provider for my family, I stay focused and deliver. For instance, despite external pressures to return to Lebanon, I remained committed to my goals and never wavered.  
3. **Critical Thinking and Clarity:** I challenge the status quo and focus on what truly makes sense. For example, I proposed using AI and Copilot to create an efficient chart for edge mappers, cutting through unnecessary complexity. However, when faced with urgent or business-critical problems, I act immediately without overanalyzing.

What is a weakness you have? – and how do you manage this?  
One of my weaknesses is that I can be overly blunt or logical in communication, especially in personal settings. I tend to focus on facts rather than emotions, which can sometimes come across as cold or intense to more sensitive individuals. Professionally, I’ve learned to communicate more thoughtfully and am generally perceived as approachable. In the past, I also struggled with assertiveness, often hesitating to speak up when I noticed issues. Over time, I’ve worked on this and improved significantly, which has come with experience and maturity.
 
Personal Project:  
In 2018, I embarked on a project to transform a standard industrial robot into a 6-axis milling robot. I purchased a used Staubli industrial robot, a servo drive for the turning table, and designed my own electrical panel. You can view some videos of the “Woodbot” here:  
[https://youtu.be/maOd_5g8niA](https://youtu.be/maOd_5g8niA).  
Although the project ultimately failed to be profitable, it taught me valuable lessons about the challenges of entrepreneurship.

I also experimented with AI by creating a Unity3D simulation that users can interact with, using an OpenAI assistant integrated with a knowledge base and function-calling APIs.

**Personal**:  
I am married and have a daughter born in 2020. We live in Solna, which offers the perfect balance of being outside the city center while remaining close to Stockholm.  
At the age of 23, following my father’s passing, I took on the responsibility of providing for my siblings, which taught me family responsibilities early in life. My primary goal is to provide the best possible life for my daughter, which is why we moved from Lebanon to Sweden—one of the best countries in the world for raising children.  
Personally, I feel a strong connection to European and Swedish culture, lebanon was always a bridge between east and west, however in late years this bridge was somehow broken and lebanon moved more towards the east, I respect eastern culture but western culture and specially freedom of expression resonates better with me and Sweden is a Bacon of personal freedom. While I am an introvert (assertive INTP as MBTI) (that also aligns well with most Swedish people), this does not affect my professional interactions, my colleagues won't know I am introverted. I enjoy business travel but prefer shorter trips now that I have a young child.
I have a work permit, it is my second two years work permit and i am not under northvolt's name anymore. the work permit end in September 2025, if everything worked properly I will have my permanent residency in September 2025.
I was born in Sin-El-Fil Lebanon in August 1983, my father was a writer (journalist and encyclopedia writer) and my mother worked in a book publishing company and a house wife. I am the oldest and have two brothers and a sister. One Brother working as journalist in Washington DC, another one in Dubai working in a company that manufactures water level sensors and my sister is also in Dubai working with Ralph Lauren in Marketing. I have no strong family ties to lebanon anymore, my father died in 2006 and my mother in 2014. I was married in 2018 to Christelle that is with me here in Solna as well as my child Chloe born in February 2020.

Describe a moment in your life that fundamentally changed your worldview. What happened, and how did it alter your perspective?  
Losing both of my parents at a young age profoundly shaped my outlook on life. My father passed away when I was 23, and my mother followed when I was 30. These losses brought immense responsibilities, such as caring for my younger siblings, and exposed me to life's harsh realities early on.
I learned that resilience and self-reliance are crucial, as no one is obligated to help you, and you cannot depend on others or a higher power to solve your problems. However, I also discovered that with strength and perseverance, you can shape life in your favor.

Have you ever felt completely out of place? How did you cope, and what did you learn from the experience?  
I adapt quickly, learning from mistakes and adjusting my beliefs when evidence suggests a better path (though my core values, like authenticity, remain constant). Over time, I felt increasingly trapped in Lebanon, surrounded by outdated beliefs, superstitions, and harmful habits.  
By my late 30s, I realized that my society was entrenched in economic and political struggles, leading to self-destruction. Driven by the desire to secure a better future for my daughter, I decided to move to a more stable country—Sweden. This decision forced me to act and ultimately transformed my life for the better (well maybe not now exactly but I believe it will).

Who has had the greatest influence on the person you are today? What did they teach you, directly or indirectly?  
Several people have had a profound impact on me.  
My father instilled in me strong principles and values, along with a deep love for my country. I embraced those values but adapted them to my perspective. He also taught me the importance of independent thinking.  
My mother demonstrated unwavering dedication in raising us despite the many challenges she faced.  
The founder of Technica inspired me with his resilience—building and sustaining a company in Lebanon during the war and persisting through the country's difficult times. While I admire his optimism about Lebanon, I consider myself more pragmatic.  
Finally, my wife and child have unknowingly motivated me to strive for a better life for them, which has had the most significant impact on me.

What keeps you grounded or pushes you forward on tough days?  
When I face challenging days, I remind myself of the bigger picture. I think about the people who depend on me, like my wife and daughter, and the responsibilities I have toward them.  
I also reflect on the obstacles I've overcome in the past (and there have been many) and how they've made me stronger.  
This perspective helps me stay grounded and motivates me to keep moving forward, knowing I have the strength and resilience to overcome any challenges.

Have you ever made a decision that defied others' expectations but felt undeniably right? What was that like?  
Yes, both professionally and personally. I've made decisions that went against others' expectations but felt right for me. For instance, when I decided to move to Sweden, many questioned my choice, as it meant leaving behind my family, friends, and the company I had been with for 15 years.  
Professionally, I've had moments where I stood my ground, which some might call stubbornness, but I trust my intuition when backed by experience. For example, I once resolved a network issue with a remote device in China. While the platform team insisted it was due to a Chinese ISP restriction, I trusted my instincts and identified the problem as a firmware issue. Despite poor remote access, I found a way to update the firmware and successfully fixed the issue.

What’s a truth about yourself that took you years to accept?
That I may not fit in properly in certain societies.

Is there a version of yourself from the past that you sometimes miss? What part of them do you wish you still had today?
Yes, over the years, I’ve developed a thick skin. However, I sometimes wish I could regain my hypersensitivity or softer side to better empathize and connect with others. At times, my thick skin can make me feel a bit detached.

What’s a job or task that made you question your entire career path—and how did you handle that doubt?
I often question whether transitioning from hardware to software was the right decision, especially with the rapid advancements in AI. However, seeing the complexity involved in real-world software products gives me some reassurance. Additionally, I can always combine my expertise in both fields to contribute to the growing field of Physical AI, which is currently gaining significant attention.

Tell me about a time you had to work with someone you couldn’t stand. How did you manage it? What did it teach you?
There was a time I had to work with someone who clearly had narcissistic tendencies. He would mock others—sometimes even those who weren’t very sharp or may have had learning difficulties—just to gain social traction. He often used manipulative tactics to get what he wanted, crossing ethical lines. I did raise the issue with my manager, but at the time, his hands were tied.
I focused on staying as professional as possible, knowing that people like that often get caught up in their own mess eventually—and that’s exactly what happened. He didn’t last long. It definitely tested my patience, though. I was younger back then, and in hindsight, I think I should have escalated it further up the chain of command.

When was the last time you really struggled to learn something professionally? How did you push through?
I transitioned from automation and control into software engineering—a much more technical world where the way products are built is completely different. The people around me were incredibly sharp and knowledgeable. Back in automation, I was often the smartest in the room, but that was no longer the case. So I pushed myself hard, learning as fast as I could and focusing on showcasing my strengths wherever I could add value.

What’s a professional risk you took that changed everything for you—whether it worked out or not?
I shifted from mechanical design to automation engineering back in 2008. Was it a risk? Yes, but a relatively small one. I was stepping away from a field closely aligned with my academic background into something a bit more distant. Still, it paid off—I was able to prove myself quickly, thanks to my strong programming skills.

What motivates you the most in a work environment, and how do you ensure you stay engaged during repetitive or less exciting tasks?
When it comes to repetitive or less exciting tasks, I treat them as systems to improve. My mindset is: if a task feels boring, it's probably a candidate for automation or optimization.
I also keep the bigger picture in mind—knowing that even mundane tasks can be critical to the success of something I believe in. Painful but necessary, i don't run away from "not fun" work as long as it is both necessary and temporary.
That sense of ownership keeps me engaged. And if there's room, I often introduce small changes or process improvements to make the work smarter, not just harder.
